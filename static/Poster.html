        <h1>LearnBraille101: An Educational Website for Sighted People</h1>
        <p>Presenter: Jennifer Stibbins, CSSE. 
            Advisor: Professor Robert Dimpsey. 
            Spring through Fall 2024. 
            University of Washington Bothell</p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Encourage sighted people to learn more about braille and blindness</li>
            <li>Convert a Unified English Braille (UEB) photo into English text</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>QR Code and URL</h2>
        <a href="https://submitpng-gugaefhpdxalejer.westus-01.azurewebsites.net">Website url</a>
        <p>The manual website url is as follows: https://submitpng-gugaefhpdxalejer.westus-01.azurewebsites.net</p>
        <p>The QR code is not included because it only lasts seven days.</p>


        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Azure</li>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>Git</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goal 1: Research</h2>
        <h3>Sighted users can explore topics of interest and discover new ones.</h3>
        <h4>General User</h4>
        <p>"How does braille work? Can I learn to read it, too?"</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tools and supplies</li>
            <li>Learning braille</li>
            <li>Practice reading</li>
            <li>Practice writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>End of website screenshot.</p>


        <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>"How can I make my website/project more screen reader friendly?"</p>
        <p>While reading, the software engineer might also start learning about design strategies
            for making a website more accessible for people who struggle with light sensitivity.</p>
        
        <h4>Author</h4>
        <p>"I don't have a visual disability. Is it okay if I create a character who has one?
            What does 'good' representation entail?"</p>
        <p>A Sighted author is looking to create a character with a visual disability, but wants
            input from the blidn community about what "good" representation looks like.
            While reading, the author might come across the "Do's and Don'ts as a Sighted Person,
            according to Blind/Low Vision People" or "Employment" sections of the LearnMore page
            and incorporate information from there into their writing. The author might decide to
            publish their book as an audiobook as well, or hire a blind/low vision person as a
            consultant on their material.</p>
        
        <h2>Goal 2: Convert</h2>
        <h3>Sighted braille learners can check their accuracy while learning.</h3>
        <p>Parents/Loved ones and educators are the primary intended audience for this section.<br>
        Individuals experiencing slow-onset sight loss may also benefit from using it.</p>
        
        <p><b>Strategies for Dot Detection:</b> Light-based. Dual approach (shadows and peaks).
            Tiling and reassembly for inconsistent lighting.</p>
        <p><b>Strategies for Dot Identification and Cell Detection:</b> UEB standardized dimensions. 
            Average dot diameter. Average distance between adjacent dots.</p>

        <p>Conversion Process Photos</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Original photo: grade1 UEB saying “re be ligh” (segment of the phrase let there be light).</li>
            <li>After Dot Detection: same photo, but with green pixels for peaks and black dots for shadows.</li>
            <li>After Cell Detection: cells = [[1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 5], 0, [1, 2, 3]. [2, 4], [1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 5]]</li>
            <li>Output Text: TEXT = re be ligh</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <h3>Continue after graduation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Conduct survey for website feedback</b> (paid for B/VI respondents)</li>
            <li><b>Refactor UEB to text conversion</b> for higher accuracy rate 
                and to allow a wider variety of valid inputs (e.g. multi-line slanted page)</li>
            <li><b>Reorganize website</b> to better comply with W3C and WCAG guidelines</li>
            <li><b>Incorporate recently learned languages and frameworks (JavaScript, React)</b> to
                create a more visually appealing experience for Sighted users, while still
                being screen reader accessible</li>
            <li><b>Include dark mode / light mode radio button</b> to allow a more customied user experience</li>
            <li><b>Enable feedback feature</b> to allow B/VI users to like and dislike resources given, 
                as well as suggest additions or removals</li>
        </ul>

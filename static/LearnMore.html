			<p> If you try to think of famous blind people, Helen Keller (1880-1968) might come to mind, or Louis Braille (1809-1852). In other words, people who aren't alive anymore. 

			<ul>
				<li> Real people (who are also still alive, as of 2024): </li>
					<ul>
						<li> Stevie Wonder (musician): This could just be me being oblivious, but even though I recognize the name "Stevie Wonder" and have heard many of his songs, I didn't know he was blind, nor did I know he was black until I began learning about blind public figures. </li>
				<img src="static/images/images_learnmore/Stevie_Wonder.jpeg" alt="Stevie Wonder smiles onstage in a black and blue suit with a microphone in his hand." width="210" height="210"/>
						<li> Edgar Winter (musician): Edgar Winter plays the keyboard, the sax, and the drums consecutively in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8f-Qb-bwlU">"Frankenstein . Edgar Winters Group . 1973"</a> (video posted by Michael Callaghan Music: 9 minutes, 18 seconds). In 1969, he played at Woodstock with his brother as the Winters Brothers Band. He also has solo albums with debuts ranging from 1970 to 2022. His 2022 album is named "Brother Johnny", after his brother who passed away in 2014 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Winter">Edgar Winter</a> (wikipedia article), <a href="https://edgarwinter.com/bio/">Edgar Winter</a> (website)). In the picture shown, Johnny is on the left and Edgar is on the right. </li>

					</ul>
				<li> Characters in TV/Movies: </li>
					<ul>
						<li> Daredevil / Matt Murdock from the TV show "Daredevil": A classic example of having "super senses" in order to become more independent and 'abled' than the average sighted person. </li>

     height="210"/> 
						<li> Toph Beifong from the TV show "Avatar: The Last Airbender": Although her character includes some super-powered-ness, from what I can tell, she is generally looked upon favorably by the blind community in terms of representation, and is often even a favorite. </li>

						<li> Geordi LaForge from "Star Trek: The Next Generation": Although blind, his visor lets him see more than the average sighted person. </li>
						<img src="static/images/images_learnmore/Geordi-LaForge-Star-Trek-LeVar-Burton_cropped.jpeg" alt="Character Lieutenant Geordi LaForge from 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' stands facing the camera wearing a visor that allows him to see more than the average sighted person." width="247", height="204.5"/>

						<li> Uchiha Itachi from "Naruto" and "Naruto: Shippuden". Born sighted, but experiences progressive vision loss as a "punishment" for overusing his power. He is portrayed as "evil" for much of the show. One of the strongest people in the show. Murderer.] </li>

				<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CseaTVIJOhY">5 Myths About Being Blind</a> (video by Molly Burke: 12 minutes, 10 seconds). I appreciate that this video (starting at around 8 minutes, 30 seconds) clarifies that the definition of legally blind is in reference to the vision a person has with maximum correction-- in other words, at their "best" vision, not their "worst". For example, although my uncorrected vision is worse than 20/200, corrections through strong glasses put me at almost 20/20. I am very much sighted. </li>

			<li> Right to schooling/education: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act">Individuals With Disabilities Education Act</a> [IDEA] (wikipedia article) </li>
			<li> ~90% of blind/low vision students in the US attend public school rather than schools for the blind (<a href="https://www.miusa.org/resource/tip-sheets/highschoolplacements/#:~:text=Mainstream%20High%20School%20or%20School,low%20vision%20high%20school%20students.">High School Placements for Blind and Low Vision Students</a> (article by Mobility International USA [MIUSA])) </li>

			<li> Mainstream = general education. When a student 'goes mainstream', that means they are attending a public/private school that is not exclusive to any particular group [FIX definition...]</li>

		</ul>
<p> Schools for the blind can be good for finding community and learning specific blind-related skills such as braille, cane usage, or O&M. However, mainstream students are reputed as being better socialized and prepared for adult life. </p>

<p> The type of school a person attends doesn't automatically dictate the experiences or outcomes they will have. Additionally, what works for one person may not work for someone else. </p>

		<h3>Community Overlaps</h3>
		<p> Just as a community is made of many people, one person can belong to many communities. Sometimes communities are made by nature of a specific set of shared overlaps, such as with the DeafBlind community. <br> <br>  Intersectionality with race, gender, gender expression, sexuality, religion, nationality, neurodivergence, disability, age, socioeconomic status, or other components of one's identity can and do happen. Gathering around a shared trait does not reduce the uniqueness of each individual. </p>

		<h3>Canes</h3>
		<p> According to the National Federation of the Blind, fewer than 10% of people who are visually impaired use a white cane, with most estimates for cane usage ranging from around two to eight percent (<a href="https://nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics">Blindness Statistics</a>, "Mobility" section). </p>

		<p> Since a cane is a very obvious social indicator of disability, many Blind people are reluctant to use one. [ADD more detail / resources] </p>

		<h3>Glasses</h3>
		<p> Some blind or low vision people wear sunglasses, some don't. Those who do wear sunglasses may not wear them all the time. </p>
		<p> Here are some reasons blind or low vision people might wear sunglasses: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Light sensitivity </li>
			<li> For sighted people's comfort</li>
			<li> For one's own comfort and/or privacy. Glasses can potentially help with reducing the amount of nosy questions a person receives from random sighted people. For example, if your eyes don't look or move in ways that society considers "normal", you might get questions. On the other hand, if your eyes <I>do</I> look "normal" (e.g. your eyes have iris pigmentation, don't shake, and you can do things like coordinated eye tracking or making eye contact), you might receive questions or for not "looking" blind enough or even be accused of faking it. </li>
			<li> Low vision. The public generally thinks of blind and low vision people as wearing sunglasses. Wearing sunglasses can act as a sort of... hint to sighted people. </li>
			<li> Safety(fully blind and might not be able to feel the pain, protecting against sun in your eyes)</li>

		<h3>Guide Dogs</h3>
		<p> According to the National Federation of the Blind, about 2% of visually impaired people have guide dogs (<a href="https://nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics">Blindness Statistics</a>, "Mobility" section). </p>

		<h2 id="braille">Braille: strengths and weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
			<p>This section describes some pros and cons to braille as it exists and is used now, going beyond just the "yay, braille lets people read with their fingers!" layer. </p>
			<li> Structure </li>
				<ul>
					<li> (+) Reusability. Since braille is a code, not its own language, the same six-dot cell can be used across countless languages! This also makes standardization of printing less complex. </li>
					<li> (+) Versatility of audience. Although you might associate braille only with blind people, braille is also accessible to DeafBlind people. And, sighted people can read it to, if they want. Most anyone with enough time, money, interest, and tactile sensitivity can learn to read braille. </li>
					<li> (-) Space. Braille takes up a lot of space! EX: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qFuH9H_3ePQ">What one Harry Potter book in braille looks like</a> (YouTube short by Blindonthemove). Contractions help with this, but contracted braille is still not nearly as compact as visually-read languages. </li>
					<li> (-) Learning curve. It definitely takes a lot of time, effort, and support to learn to read braille. However, it's worth noting that the same could be said for learning to read visual text. </li>
				</ul>
			<li> Society </li>
				<ul>
					<li> (-) Cost. The high cost of braille materials is a barrier to braille accessibility. For reference, <a href="http://www.braillebookstore.com/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer%27s-Stone.1">"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"</a> costs about $70-$100 on the braillebookstore. The visual (and fairly thin) paperback of the exact same book might cost around $4-$20 depending on whether you get it used or new, and is probably available for free at your local library. </li>
					<li> (+/-) Awareness. </li>
					<li> (+/-?) Recent advances / Technology </li>

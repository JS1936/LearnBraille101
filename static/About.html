		<p>Marginalized groups are often expected to educate non-members about their community.</p>
		<p><b>LearnBraille101</b> is a collection of resources created in the hopes that sighted people can gather basic knowledge about the blind and low vision community without 
			incurring further intellectual and emotional stress on its members. If someone wants to explain a topic or experience to a non-member, that's great.
			However, they are in no way obligated to do this.</p>
		<p>Please do not pester blind or low vision people with questions.</p>

        <h1>Slides Transcript</h1>
        <h2>Slide 1: LearnBraille101</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone. My name is Jennifer, and today we're going to be discussing “LearnBraille101”. “LearnBraille101” is an educational website where sighted people can learn about braille, blindness, and the blind community. <br><br>
            It's free, publicly available, currently collects over 100 resources in one place, and makes primary sources a priority. This means it gathers information from the blind community itself, or relevant organizations, when possible.
            </p>
        <h2>Slide 2: Before We Start</h2>
        <p>
            Here is a link to said website: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tfy_tkAtg97Cwr4gJyfTu_q9JImO7SYJNZ1bPiWw0NI/edit#slide=id.g30e8d891bd7_0_170">website link</a><br>
            Feel free to take a picture now, or enter the link manually.<br>
            <br>
            If you go to the Presentation subpage, you should be able to see these slides, as well as a corresponding screen reader friendly transcript. The Presentation subpage also has my colloquium poster. Since the poster is a photo, it is not accessible to screen readers, so there is an HTML link that describes the same content.<br>
            <br>
            You might notice that the webpages are not the most… aesthetically pleasing. Even I find the website a bit cramped and overwhelming, and I made it. This is because I prioritized making the pages screen reader accessible first, and so far, CSS, a coding language commonly used for making web pages look “pretty”, has been interfering with screen readers. In the future, these pages will look a lot more pleasant.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 3: How the Project and Its Goals Evolved Over Time</h2>
        <p>
            While you work on that, I'd like to talk a little about the evolution of my goals for this capstone. As demonstrated by these lovely pokemon, I started with big ambitions and had to adjust as I gained a better understanding of what was realistic for a nine month individual project.
            <br><br>
            I first started this capstone with the intention of creating a more affordable braille display. These are often over a thousand dollars, and I wanted to create something in the mid hundreds. This was out of my league. I've never even used a braille display before, since they're so expensive. Again, I had to adjust.
            <br><br>
            I convinced myself into believing that I was downscaling when I shifted my goal to create a more affordable braillewriter, which is basically like a typewriter, but instead of pressing ink into a page, you're embossing paper braille.
            <br><br>
            But, there was the same sort of issue. And, at this point, I had also conducted a survey of people in the blind community and I was just starting to realize that maybe I shouldn't be trying to create a “better” version of a product I've never even used, for a community I'm not even in.
            <br><br>
            So, where I ended up is this charmeleon here- creating a website aimed toward educating sighted people about the basics of blindness and braille, and a second component of being able to convert Unified English Braille into English text.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 4: Before We Start</h2>
        <p>There are a few terms I need to introduce before continuing.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Braille:</b> a tactile <em>code</em> for an existing language</li>
            <li><b>Braille cell:</b> similar to a 'letter' in English. Combinations of raised dots have different meanings. <br>In the example shown, the dots 1,2,3, and 5 create an 'r'.</li>
            <li><b>Unified English Braille (UEB):</b> the current standard for English braille in the USA.</li>
            <li><b>Embossed paper braille:</b> unmoving raised dots written on special paper.</li>
            <li><b>Electronic braille:</b> moveable pins used in devices such as refreshable braille displays.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Slide 5: Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The goals of my project website are to encourage Sighted people to learn more about braille and blindness, and to be able to convert a photo of UEB braille into English text.
            <br><br>
            My faculty advisor was Professor Robert Dimpsey.
            <br>
            My sponsors were Professor Yang Peng, and also Superintendent Scott McCallum of the Washington State School for the Blind, or WSSB.
            <br><br>
            In terms of a timeline of events, spring quarter focused on research, including a survey.
            <br>
            Summer quarter was about starting to compile that research into a website, and brainstorm approaches I could take for converting braille into English. Fall quarter meant implementing the braille to English conversion I designed, and arranging remote deployment of the website so that it was available to any user, not just locally on my computer.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 6: Survey</h2>
        <p>In Spring quarter, I conducted a preliminary survey to gauge what kinds of tools and technologies blind and low vision people were using in their daily lives.</p>
        <p>I had three main takeaways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I needed to learn how to use a screen reader, and I needed to make my website screen reader accessible.</li>
            <li>In future surveys, I should pay the participants.</li>
            <li>As mentioned earlier, it also helped me reframe the project to be aimed toward helping sighted people learn basic information, rather than creating a complex product that I've never even used, for a community of which I am not a member.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Slide 7: Website</h2>
        <p>[Full slide text here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sections</li>
            <li>UX</li>
            <li>Creation / Execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>The website has six main sections, this is a view of the home page right here. There's “About”, “LearnBraille”, “LearnMore”, “Convert”, “Design”, and “Presentation”.
            <br><br>
            For the UX, or user experience, the pages are in dark mode, with large buttons and large text. If you want to know more about the design, you can go to the “Design” page, and then we can go into the creation and execution now.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Slide 8: Website Creation</h2>
        <p>For creating the website, I used HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, and Git locally.<br>
            I used GitHub for version control and remote storage, and I synced the repository to my Azure web app, which publicly deploys the website so that users can access it. This means that whenever I updated GitHub, the website would update as well.<br><br>
            
            When making changes, I pulled from my GitHub in order to make sure I was using the most recent version.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 9: Helpful Courses</h2>
        <p>The three most helpful courses for this project were web programming, cloud computing, and data structures.
            <br><br>
            Taking web programming this quarter helped me become more comfortable using HTML and CSS. Cloud computing gave me experience using Azure Web Services (AWS), so I had a small introduction to remote deployment moving to Azure for this project. It also introduced me to Flask. Lastly, without CSS 342, I would not have had the coding fundamentals needed to even begin to write the braille to text conversion.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 10: Conversion</h2>
        <p>Speaking of, how does that work, exactly? Let's walk through what that process entails.
            <br><br>
            The goal is clear- given a photo of embossed braille, convert it into English text, like the example here. In this case, it would become the English text “www.braillebooks.com”.
        </p>
        <h2>Slide 11: Conversion: User Walkthrough</h2>
        <p>As a user, these are the steps you would take:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, from the home page, click the “Convert” button. You will be redirected to the “Convert” page.</li>
            <li>To use the example photo, click “Download Photo”.</li>
            <li> Then click “Choose Photo”, and you'll be able to select the desired photo from your Downloads. It needs to be a png file because the conversion involves breaking the picture into pieces and reassembling it, and we don't want to lose data.</li>
            <li>Finally, click “Upload Photo”, and wait while the python files run. When results are ready, the user is moved to a new page where the output text should appear.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Slide 12: Conversion</h2>
        <p>
            For conversion, the main use case of this is for sighted people who want to learn braille and want to be able to check the accuracy of their reading or writing. Users of this feature could be family members, loved ones, or educators, for example. Another use case would be for someone with slow-onset vision loss, so someone who's anticipating no longer being able to read inked text at some point, and just wants to kind of ease into reading braille.
            <br><br>
            The website abcbraille.com is an existing option for braille to English text conversion, but it sometimes fails, especially with more zoomed in images. I wanted to try to make something that could perform as well or better, particularly since that website is volunteer run and not guaranteed to remain available.
            <br><br>
            We'll get into the strategies, struggles and solutions, and an example now.

        </p>
        <h2>Slide 13: Conversion: Why Use Shadows <em>and</em> Highlights?</h2>
        <p>Originally, I only used highlights, or “peaks” (shown in green). However, in poor lighting conditions, false negatives occurred. Some braille dots wouldn't get detected.
            <br><br>
            I then switched to using only “shadows” (shown in black). This had a similar problem. Some braille dots wouldn't get detected… different braille dots than the ones the peaks missed.
            <br><br>
            By using both, accuracy of dot detection increases dramatically.
            <br> 
            While there are cases where a dot gets picked up “twice”, by both peaks and shadows, this duplicate positive is a lot easier to deal with than a false negative.
            <br>
            In this second image, you can see how the position 2 dot was only detected due to shadow, while dots 1 and 3 were only detected due to peaks, and dot 5 was detected by both. 
            <br>
            This diagram on the right goes into more detail about how I used dictionaries to store dot data and determine a dot would begin and end.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 14: Conversion Example</h2>
        <p>The overall process has three main parts.
            <br><br>
            First, the original photo. You take that and perform dot detection, which we just talked about.
            <br>
            Once you have the dot coordinates, you turn those into cells. For one cell, this would be like seeing a bunch of pixels on a page and realizing that, together, they make up the letter 'a'.
            <br>
            Using the cells, we use abcbraille.com to finally get the output text.
            <br><br>
            I like this example because it's short, simple, and also shows the importance of spaces, which were a little difficult to handle. The phrase segment “re be ligh”, part of “Let there be light”, could look like “rebel” and some letters after it, if spaces weren't accounted for.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 15: Next Steps</h2>
        <p>This project has a lot of work to do. My capstone poster's “Next Steps” section has a more detailed version of this. 
            For now, I'm going to focus on three items in that list. 
            First, getting feedback. The home page currently has links to an upcoming survey to gather information about how the website could be improved. 
            The first ten B/VI respondents will be paid.
        </p>
        <p>Second, conversions. The dot detection and identification have very high rates of success, but cell detection and cells to text still need significant improvements. There is a webdriver error occurring in cells to text that is preventing remote users from viewing the output text. Local users can run very simple test cases successfully.</p>   
        <p>Third, website hosting. My free “Azure Student Plan” will be expiring, and I will need to transfer either to a different plan within Azure, or to a different hosting and deployment service entirely. When doing this, I would also change the url to be more intuitive for someone looking for the website.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Slide 16: Top 3 Recommendations</h2>
        <p>I have three top recommendations for areas to visit on the website.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Do's and Don'ts as a Sighted Person, according to Blind/Low Vision People</u> <br>
                One resource here I really like is about how to be a safe, respectful sighted guide, 
                if the person wants to be guided.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u>Resources for Learning and Practicing Braille (Reading and Writing)</u><br>
                By this, I just mean the LearnBraille page. This is not a specific section name, like the other two are.</li>
            <br>
            <li><u>Law / Legal Protections (and lack thereof)</u><br>
                The third section has many pending additions, but for now I would highly recommend 
                checking out Garbero's paper, “Rights Not Fundamental: Disability and the Right to Marry”. 
                It's hugely important, and she describes the issues in a way that is easy to understand.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Slide 17: Acknowledgements</h2>

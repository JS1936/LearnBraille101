      		<h1>Design</h1>
      		<p> [DESIGN and DESIGN DECISIONS] </p>
		<p> "Dark mode" - To improve accessibility for low vision readers and people with light sensitivity, the background is black with white text, rather than white with black text. </p>
		<p> "Primary sources as a priority" - Getting information from the community itself, when possible.</p>

		<h1>Implementation </h1>
		<p> All pages were created using HTML in Visual Studio Code on a MacBook Pro. </p>
		<p> All pages have a black background with white text. Buttons/Boxes are gray.</p>
		<p> Unclicked and clicked links are different colors. When hovering, links turn red and underlines (Note: testing out color options for clicked and unclicked links, so exact colors may vary from page to page). </p>
		<p> All images have detailed alt text descriptions. </p>
		<p> All text is enlarged (to at least 20pt). </p>
		<p> All buttons are enlarged and have a color distinctly different than both text and the background.</p>
		<p> Button navigation is inspired by and modeled after that of johnleeclark.com. </p>
		<p> Consistent button placement: each subpage has a "Back" button at the top to return to the main page. </p>
		<p> HTML tags are used consistently and with screen readers in mind. </p>
		<p> Resources listed convey information across several sensory input modalities. Examples include but are not limited to videos (video and audio) and articles (print and sometimes audio).</p>

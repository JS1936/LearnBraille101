			<h2> Reading!</h2>
			<p>Please be gentle when reading! It's easier to pick up information with a gentle touch rather than a heavy touch. Also, heavy pressure or techniques such as scrubbing can wear down embossed dots and make them harder to feel/discern for future readers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Why are there different kinds of braille?
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<p>Braille is a code to represent the text of an existing language in tactile form. 
						Depending on the language, the code is different! Languages that share the same letter system (EX: English and Spanish) generally have similar codes. Languages with different letter systems (EX: English and <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Braille">Korean</a>) have way different braille codes! In other words, if you can read English braille but don't understand Spanish, you could probably read a lot of Spanish-based braille letter by letter but wouldn't know what it means. </p>
						<p>For example, if you can read UEB grade two (contracted), try to sight read the braille shown in the following three images. All say the same word, but the first is in English, the second is in Spanish, and the third is in German.</p>
						<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/English_Butterfly.png" alt="Braille for the word 'butterfly' in English." width="381" height="82">
						<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Spanish_Butterfly.png" alt="Braille for the word 'butterfly' in Spanish." width="326" height="82">
						<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/German_Butterfly.png" alt="Braille for the word 'butterfly' in German." width="425" height="82">
						<p>In case you want to check your reading, from left to right, these UEB braille cells read: "butterfly", "mariposa", and "schmetterling". </p>
						<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Butterfly.jpg" alt="Butterfly" width="177" height="177">
						<p>On the other hand, if you know English and not Korean, Korean-based braille would probably feel like a random assortment of English letters, when they really represent Korean letters. Since braille uses a six dot cell, it's not like different languages have their own unique dot combinations. Instead, the same dot combination can be assigned to have a different meaning.</p>
						<p>For example, the following braille does NOT say "hude". It actually means butterfly again, but in Mandarin (mainland Chinese with no tones) this time! (Converter: https://www.lddgo.net/en/common/braille)</p>
						<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Chinese_Butterfly.png" alt="Braille for the word 'butterfly' in Chinese." width="237" height="92">
				</ul>

				<li> What kind of Braille should I use? --> It depends! In general, language (EX: English, Spanish, Korean) and purpose (EX: math, literature, music) are good indicators.
					<ul>
						<li> Are you trying to communicate with a specific person using braille? If so, then it would probably be a good idea to learn whatever braille that person uses! Also, check to see if that person would actually prefer to communicate with you via braille. For instance, if the person is Hearing, they might rather talk with you verbally. They might be fine texting back and forth with text-to-speech technology. <Add note here> </li>
						<li> Are you trying to learn whatever is most commonly used in the US for English speakers? As of 2024, that's Unified English Braille (UEB)! </li> 
						<li> Braille for different subjects: </li>
							<ul>
								<li> Math! Nemeth code is used for math. Here's an introduction to Nemeth code: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG5syN7GYTY">Nemeth Lesson 1 Numbers and Numeric Indicator</a> (note: maybe add an article, too, or choose a different video)</li>
								<li> Music! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhQgXNLPVLc">What is braille music notation and how does it work? | Discover Instruments | Classic FM</a></li>

								<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Music.jpg" alt="Visual sheet music." width="188" height="177">
							</ul>
					</ul>	
				<li> How do I... move across the Braille dots properly? --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbUmaUV02gg">Braille Tracking Techniques (North Dakota School for the Blind)</a>(video) (8 minutes, 39 seconds)</li>
				<li> What if I have limited mobility, or limited sensitivity in my fingers? --> It depends. The following ideas do not guarantee that you will be able to read braille:</li>
					<ul>
						<li> For limited mobility, a refreshable braille display with a single line that holds fewer cells might help.</li>
						<li> For limited sensitivity, one option is to try to figure out which fingers have the best sensitivity and focus on using those fingers when reading. </li>
						<li> Note: If tactile reading is painful, please be careful! </li>
					</ul>
				<li> How can I access tactile (rather than visual) braille as a sighted person who does not qualify for government support programs? --> The <a href="http://www.braillebookstore.com/Braille-Bookstore">braillebookstore</a> offers embossed braille books, some for under $10. </li>
				<li> What is <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/living-with-sight-loss/education-and-learning/braille-tactile-codes/contracted-grade-2-braille-explained/">contracted braille</a>?</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQLxJ2-zwVk">Demonstration of reading braille - an extract from Harry Potter read aloud</a> (video from RIBDCRenwick, 43 seconds). Note: not everyone in the blind or low vision community reads this fast. Some may read slower, and some may read faster.</li>
				<li> Why am I so SLOW at reading braille? How do I get faster? </li>
					<ul>
						<li> Everyone starts out slow. When first learning to read visual text, you probably weren't very fast either. Learning to read using a different medium (tactile rather than visual) takes time and practice.</li>
						<li> One way to read faster (beyond just practice) is proficiency with contractions. Using contractions, it takes fewer symbols to express the same content. <br> For example, the word 'Knowledge' in grade 1 UEB braille uses 9 cells, whereas in grade 2 UEB it only needs two! <br>
								<img style="text-align:center;" src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Knowledge_grade1.png" alt="The world 'Knowledge' in grade 1 UEB braille." width="444" height="79"/> <img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Knowledge_grade2.png" alt="The world 'Knowledge' in grade 2 UEB braille." width="91" height="79"/> <br> For more information about targeted practice (identifying and working on weak points), check out the <a href="#read">Practice reading</a> section. </li>
						<li> Reading fatigue. Just as our eyes can get tired, our fingers can get tired, too. Sometimes, as we read braille, our fingers can get desensitized (or overstimulated) during that reading session, and identifying dots and their positions gets harder. Taking a break can help with this. Some braille displays actually have settings where you can adjust the dot "sharpness". For some, slightly lowering dot sharpness can help with being able to read longer.</li>
								<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Reading_Fatigue.jpeg" alt="A cartoon man is hunched over a desk with his eyes closed, looking tired. This picture is also kind of cool because the position of his hand makes it seem like he could be reading braille, although that was probably not the intention of the artist." width="225" height="225"/> 
					</ul>

				<li> Can I learn braille as an adult? --> Probably! Many adults have done so successfully.
					<ul> 
						<li> Here are some potential motivators for learning braille as an adult:
							<ul>
								<li> Experiencing sudden or gradual vision loss later in life </li>
								<li> Wanting to support a loved one </li>
								<li> Wanting to work as a TVI (Teacher of Students with Visual Impairments)</li>
								<li> Wanting to learn a new skill </li>
							</ul>
						<li> Some examples:

				<li><a href="https://www.pathstoliteracy.org/dots-families-braille-lessons/">15 Practice Sheets (UEB)</a>
				<li>You can create your own reading sheets using <a href="https://abcbraille.com/text">abcbraille.com/text</a>! For example, here's a sentence I made (UEB, grade2/contracted) using this link:</li>
				<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Hello, I'm Bob.png" alt="The phrase 'Hello, I'm Bob' in Grade 2 UEB." width="723" height="91">
			</ul>
			<h4>Tactile</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Order a book from the <a href="http://www.braillebookstore.com/Braille-Bookstore">braillebookstore</a>. <br>You can choose between Uncontracted UEB, Contracted UEB, Original Uncontracted Braille, Original Contracted Braille, and Unified English Braille. Here's a book that costs about $10: <a href="http://www.braillebookstore.com/Arthur%27s-Mystery-Envelope.1">Arthur's Mystery Envelope</a></li>
				<li>Write something in Braille, and read it back to to yourself! For example, you could use a slate and stylus to transcribe a poem you've read before. Since you already know what the poem is supposed to say, this is a good way to quickly get feedback about whether you're reading accurately or not. However, there is also a tendency to think you've "felt" a letter or word when you really just remembered what it was supposed to be.
				<li> If you have a Braille Label Maker, you can label items around the house (for example, indicating the contents of things such as cans or cabinets) and practice reading them as you go about your day.</li>
				<img src="static/images/images_learnbraille/Embossed_Braille.jpg" alt="Embossed braille" width="300" height="194">
				<p>One benefit of writing content yourself is that you can customize your practice to focus on letters or contractions that you're struggling with, rather than hoping they show up in published materials you have available to you.</p>

			<p>Two main ways to write braille manually are the following: using a slate and stylus, and using a braillewriter (such as the Perkins Brailler).</p>
			<p>A slate and stylus are less expensive (I was able to buy them for under $20 on Amazon), whereas a Perkins Brailler often costs $800 or more. However, for experienced Perkins Brailler users, it is much faster than using a slate and stylus. If you are new to writing braille, I would personally recommend going the slate and stylus route.</p> 
			<p>If buying a slate and stylus is not an option, it is possible to write (crude) braille using household materials. Personally, I found the most success with poking holes in thin cardboard with a sewing needle and inserting brads as "dots". I used a printed ruler to measure the between-dot dimensions in a cell, and crafted the alphabet so that I could practice running my fingers over it with dots that are larger than typical braille but much smaller than tennis balls.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> The YouTube channel <I>Braille Adventures</I> has a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMJeWOgiOtM">Slate and Stylus 101</a> that anticipates and explains mistakes beginners might make, as well as how to avoid said mistakes (7 minutes, 35 seconds).</li>
				<li> For an in-depth introduction to using a slate and stylus, see <I>The Maryland School for the Blind</I>'s 2019 webinar video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRDPZQ3lfzg">Braille 1 of 3: Slate & Stylus</a> (1 hour, 3 minutes, 7 seconds)</li>
				<li> The YouTube channel <I>Holly Connor</I> has a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZd0RVT1_IY">How to use a Perkins Brailler</a>, which shows Holly writing a letter to a friend using a Perkins Brailler (3 minutes, 28 seconds).</li>
				<li> For a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use a Perkins Brailler, see the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmCUAGG-zs">Introduction to the Perkins Brailler - Statewide Vision Resource Centre</a> (6 minutes, 31 seconds). Before watching, understand what a braille cell is. The Perkins Brailler has many similarities to a typewriter. Since the Perkins Brailler requires considerable, sustained finger coordination, people who play instruments (especially the piano) may find this learning process easier than those who do not have that prior experience.  People with arthritis may struggle with using a Perkins Brailler.
